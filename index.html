        <h1>Soni's write-ups</h1>

        <p>I'm Soni, and I have many opinions, some controversial, that others would call stupid or weird. This is the page where I try to justify and argument for my opinions.</p>
        <p>You may have been directed here if we had an argument or talked about our opinions - feel free to explore the site and shoot me a message if you want to have a friendly discussion :)</p>
        <p>Below are my current write-ups:</p>
