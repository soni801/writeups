            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p>I'm Soni, and I have many opinions. Some controversial, some others would call stupid or weird. This
                is the page where I try to justify and argument for my opinions.<br><br>You may have been directed
                here if we had an argument or talked about our opinions. If you want to have a further discussion,
                I'd love to! Just shoot me a message. Although I will ask that before we argue, you read through
                my write-up on what I think defines a healthy discussion, as this is how I want my discussions to
                happen.<br><br>If you don't want to have a discussion yet, or just want to read a bit more about my
                opinions, you're free to have a look around.<br><br>These are my current write-ups:</p>
