        <p>I'm Soni, and I have many opinions, some controversial, some others would call stupid or weird. This is the page where I try to justify and argument for my opinions.</p>
        <p>You may have been directed here if we had an argument or talked about our opinions. Feel free to explore the site and shoot me a message if you want to have a friendly discussion :)<br><br>These are my current write-ups:</p>
