        <h1>Before we argue</h1>

        <h3>As our world gets more and more hostile towards healthy discussions, it's clear that I have different
            views on how a discussion should take place than what a lot of other people have. Before we have a
            discussion, kindly read through this, so we can try to keep it as good as possible.</h3>

        <div id="content">
            <p>I am still, even in this world, a proud believer that healthy discussions still exist and should take
                place, and are the most healthy type of discussion. If we are going to have a discussion, I would
                like it to be as healthy as possible. I recognise that it's close to impossible to keep a discussion
                100% healthy, but it never hurts to try our best. A healthy discussion will not only be more productive
                than the counterpart, but will also keep all parties more focused and involved in the discussion. It
                will also make the argument less focused on rivalry and more on making progress and trying to explain
                and justify one's opinion, and in some cases also change someone's mind.</p>

            <p>First, let's establish what makes a discussion healthy. As I touched on, a healthy discussion is a
                discussion that goes off the premise that the point is to make progress, not to tear the other parties
                down. I would say a healthy discussion is identified by these traits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Professional language should be used, as opposed to 'slang'.</li>
                <li>All involved parties should be invested enough in the discussion that it is to their benefit to
                    continue it.</li>
                <li>The focus of the discussion should be to make progress; to justify and explain one's opinion and compare
                    it to the opinions of the opposing parties, not to tear down others or spread hate.</li>
                <li>Sources and source critics are welcome and encouraged.</li>
                <li>It is good to ask questions. Questions massively help enrich the conversation and avoiding
                    misunderstandings. They should be encouraged, not looked down on.</li>
                <li>Questions should be answered, thoroughly and in a respectful way. Not answering or being
                    disrespectful in one's response only tear down the discussion and adds nothing of value.</li>
                <li>Trying to annoy another participant only disturbs the discussion.</li>
                <li>Taking breaks is good. There is no such thing as "bitching out of a discussion" or "ragequitting",
                    breaks are healthy and encouraged to avoid burnout. Someone does not automatically lose a discussion
                    if they decide to take a break.</li>
                <li>Conclusions are decisions that all parties agree on. The discussion will not arrive at a conclusion
                    that is not agreed upon by all parties.</li>
                <li>Everyone is free to decide they have lost the discussion, but no one person can just decide that
                    they are the winner if this is not agreed upon.</li>
                <li>If someone lose interest in a discussion, they don't lose dignity by leaving. It is in fact good for
                    someone uninterested to leave, as having not all parties be interested will only damage the
                    conversation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All of these alone are things that contribute to a healthy discussion, and together they would be perfect.
                It is very rarely possible to achieve all of these, but the more, the better. As I mentioned initially,
                I believe that it is still possible, and good, to have a healthy discussion.</p>

            <p>So, in conclusion, all discussions I have are discussions that I believe can be healthy, and that I want
                to be healthy. If we all try our best to follow these simple guidelines, that shouldn't be so difficult
                either.</p>
