# Before we argue

---

### As our world gets more and more hostile towards healthy discussions, it's clear that I have different views on how a discussion should take place than what a lot of other people have. Before we have a discussion, kindly read through this, so we can try to keep it as good as possible.

I am still, even in this world, a proud believer that healthy discussions still exist and should take place, and are the
most healthy type of discussion. If we are going to have a discussion, I would like it to be as healthy as possible. I
recognise that it's close to impossible to keep a discussion 100% healthy, but it never hurts to try our best. A healthy
discussion will not only be more productive than the counterpart, but will also keep all parties more focused and
involved in the discussion. It will also make the argument less focused on rivalry and more on making progress and
trying to explain and justify one's opinion, and in some cases also change someone's mind.

First, let's establish what makes a discussion healthy. As I touched on, a healthy discussion is a discussion that goes
off the premise that the point is to make progress, not to tear the other parties down. I would say a healthy discussion
is identified by these traits:

 - Professional language should be used, as opposed to 'slang'.
 - All involved parties should be invested enough in the discussion that it is to their benefit to continue it.
 - The focus of the discussion should be to make progress; to justify and explain one's opinion and compare it to the
opinions of the opposing parties, not to tear down others or spread hate.
 - Sources and source critics are welcome and encouraged.
 - It is good to ask questions. Questions massively help enrich the conversation and avoiding misunderstandings. They
should be encouraged, not looked down on.
 - Questions should be answered, thoroughly and in a respectful way. Not answering or being disrespectful in one's
response only tear down the discussion and adds nothing of value.
 - Trying to annoy another participant only disturbs the discussion.
 - Taking breaks is good. There is no such thing as "bitching out of a discussion" or "ragequitting", breaks are healthy
and encouraged to avoid burnout. Someone does not automatically lose a discussion if they decide to take a break.
 - Conclusions are decisions that all parties agree on. The discussion will not arrive at a conclusion that is not
agreed upon by all parties.
 - Everyone is free to decide they have lost the discussion, but no one person can just decide that they are the winner
if this is not agreed upon.
 - If someone loses interest in a discussion, they don't lose dignity by leaving. It is in fact good for someone
uninterested to leave, as having not all parties be interested will only damage the conversation.

All of these alone are things that contribute to a healthy discussion, and together they would be perfect. It is very
rarely possible to achieve all of these, but the more, the better. As I mentioned initially, I believe that it is still
possible, and good, to have a healthy discussion.

So, in conclusion, all discussions I have are discussions that I believe can be healthy, and that I want to be healthy.
If we all try our best to follow these simple guidelines, that shouldn't be so difficult either.
