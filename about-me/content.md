### I am weird. This write-up aims to be a short introduction, and to explain some of my 'quirks'.

I may have directed you to this write-up if you're asking questions about my behaviour, or if I've acted condescending
or rude towards you. If the latter, I'm sorry. I won't justify my actions, but I'll try to explain why they happened, in
this writeup.

In this write-up, I'll roughly cover 3 main subjects:
- [ADHD](#adhd)
- [Psychopathy](#psychopathy)
- [Depression](#depression)

> As a warning, this write-up will mention attempted suicide. If this is something you are sensitive towards, I
> recommend not reading the section about depression, or avoid the write-up altogether.

But first a small introduction. I am Samuel, but go by 'Soni' online. I'm Norwegian and work within IT, as well as have
interests within IT. I do programming and general server/IT operation and I love discussions, especially technical ones.
However, I differ from the norm in that I care a lot about the quality about a conversation, even to the point of where
I made a write-up explaining [what I think defines a healthy discussion](/healthy-discussion/). Unfortunately, the fact
that I love discussions does create bad situations as I often find myself in arguments about trivial matters, something
that annoys a lot of the people around me. Let me try to explain why this keeps happening:

### ADHD

I have ADHD. Well, sort of. Well, I do, but not 'officially'. Explaining this might be difficult, but I'll try to give
you the short version: The Norwegian healthcare system sucks. Put simply, only some specific doctors are allowed to
assign diagnoses to you. It doesn't matter whether you have a certain condition, it doesn't matter whether some doctors
agree, it in some cases doesn't even matter if your GP or primary doctors agree that you have the condition, you aren't
able to get certain diagnoses unless you talk to some very specific people.

I have been to several medical professional, including doctors, all of which have agreed that it is very likely that I
have ADHD, some even saying that I _definitely_ have it. Knowing this, I went to the only authority that can give out
psychology-related diagnoses; 'BUP'. Here, I was met by complete and utter neglect and disregard. BUP actually made my
situation at the time significantly worse, something I have also heard others experience in the past. Needless to say,
they were not interested in giving me any diagnose. In fact, they weren't even interested in listening to me at all.
They didn't care about me, and cared even less about what I had to say.

Now, I am not saying that going to a psychiatrist or therapist is bad, I actually still really recommend doing it if you
are struggling or wondering if you have certain conditions. I have talked to some other people with similar experiences
and to people with different experiences, and it turns out that the psychological healthcare in Norway differs wildly
from place to place. The one I went to, 'BUP Ã˜yane', is one of the worst rated in the country, and I've heard
exclusively bad experiences from the people I have talked to. I am planning on going to a different BUP location later
to see if I'm able to get more respect there, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. I first need to realise that
despite my previous experiences, there are professionals that care about their patients.

I hope that provides some insight into the situation and explains it well, it sure was a longer explanation that I was
originally planning to write. The summary is that although I don't technically have the diagnosis, it is fairly certain
that I have ADHD.

I am planning on making an in-depth write-up about the effects ADHD have on people in the future, but for now I will
give a quick overview here.
