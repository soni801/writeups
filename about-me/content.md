### I am weird. This write-up aims to be a short introduction, and to explain some of my 'quirks'.

I may have directed you to this write-up if you're asking questions about my behaviour, or if I've acted condescending
or rude towards you. If the latter, I'm sorry. I won't justify my actions, but I'll try to explain why they might have
happened.

In this write-up, I'll roughly cover 3 main subjects:
- [ADHD](#adhd)
- [Psychopathy](#psychopathy)
- [Depression](#depression)

> As a warning, this write-up will mention attempted suicide. If this is something you are sensitive towards, I
> recommend not reading the section regarding depression, or avoid the write-up altogether.

But first a small introduction. I am Samuel, but go by 'Soni' online. I'm Norwegian and work within IT, as well as have
interests within IT. I do programming and general server/IT operation and I love discussions, especially technical ones.
However, I differ from the norm in that I care a lot about the quality about a conversation, even to the point of where
I made a write-up explaining [what I think defines a healthy discussion](/healthy-discussion/). Unfortunately, the fact
that I love discussions does create bad situations as I often find myself in arguments about trivial matters, something
that annoys a lot of the people around me. Let me try to explain why this keeps happening:

### ADHD

I have ADHD. Well, sort of. Well, I do, but not 'officially'. Explaining this might be difficult, but I'll try to give
you the short version: The Norwegian healthcare system sucks. Put simply, only some specific doctors are allowed to
assign diagnoses to you. It doesn't matter whether you have a certain condition, it doesn't matter whether some doctors
agree, it in some cases doesn't even matter if your GP or primary doctors agree that you have the condition, you aren't
able to get certain diagnoses unless you talk to some very specific people.

I have been to several medical professional, including doctors, all of which have agreed that it is very likely that I
have ADHD, some even saying that I _definitely_ have it. Knowing this, I went to the only authority that can give out
psychology-related diagnoses; 'BUP'. Here, I was met by complete and utter neglect and disregard. BUP actually made my
situation at the time significantly worse, something I have also heard others experience in the past. Needless to say,
they were not interested in giving me any diagnosis. In fact, they weren't even interested in listening to me at all.
They didn't care about me, and cared even less about what I had to say.

Now, I am not saying that going to a psychiatrist or therapist is bad, I actually still really recommend doing it if you
are struggling or wondering if you have certain conditions. I have talked to some other people with similar experiences
and to people with different experiences, and it turns out that the psychological healthcare in Norway differs wildly
from place to place. The one I went to, 'BUP Ã˜yane', is one of the worst rated in the country, and I've heard
exclusively bad experiences from the people I have talked to. I am planning on going to a different BUP location later
to see if I'm able to get more respect there, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. I first need to realise that
despite my previous experiences, there are professionals that care about their patients.

I hope that provides some insight into the situation and explains it well, it sure was a longer explanation that I was
originally planning to write. The summary is that although I don't technically have the diagnosis, it is fairly certain
that I have ADHD. And even if I don't, it is at least a way of _explaining why_ I behave like I do, even if it isn't
_the cause_ of it.

I am planning on making an in-depth write-up about the effects ADHD have on people in the future, but for now I will
give a quick overview here. As a disclaimer, I am not a medical professional. A lot of the following will be based on
personal experience and the experience of others I have talked to, but definitions and some explanations will be cited
from well renowned sources like [Oxford Languages](https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/) and
[Healthline Media](https://www.healthline.com/).

ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and the name itself describes it to a certain degree. It is
most commonly perceived as something that lowers your ability to pay attention, and gives you short bursts of energy,
called hyperactivity. The problem with ADHD is that it is a very broad term. Not only can ADHD differ wildly from person
to person, it also has several 'sub-conditions' and sets of traits that vary a lot. Because of this, I will talk about
it the way I perceive it, even though it might differ from the norm.

Let's first address the elephant in the room: the hyperactivity. ADHD is somewhat weird in that it gives both short
bursts of energy but also longer periods with significantly less energy. Overall, it makes energy management very
difficult. For me, this causes me to suddenly lose focus or interest in a conversation or activity, and can be
interpreted by others as laziness or lack of care.

ADHD makes me very impulsive, which is a problem in several parts of life. Most importantly, it makes budgeting/spending
management harder. That is outside the scope of this write-up, but I will explain it in my upcoming write-up on ADHD.
More related to the social aspect of life, it makes me not think through what I am saying before I say it. Most people
think about something before saying it, whereas I say something, then think about what I said. This can often come off
as rude, as I don't realise I'm insulting someone or something before after I've said it. It can also put me in a lot of
conversations I didn't really intend to start, as well as making me say things that is worded badly or in some cases
not even correct.

On the contrary, it also makes me less able to make decisions. In medical terms, this is called 'executive dysfunction'.
In layman's terms, it makes it harder for me to take actions or just do something. It affects my ability to choose
activities, it makes it harder to plan, it affects time management, and makes it harder to organise myself or my
environment. It also makes me more likely to procrastinate, and overall less able to find motivation or energy to work
on a given project or activity.

ADHD also impacts my memory. I will often forget things, names, voices or even faces. If you tell me to remember
something or remind you of something, chances are I will forget. I might even forget something only a few seconds after
I had the thought. Combined with executive dysfunction, this can make me really unproductive in certain conditions.
Unfortunately, todo lists or reminders don't really help. Combining bad memory with executive dysfunction, all my todo
lists just fill up more and more, until the point where there's so much on my list that I struggle navigating it. So if
I forget something, it is not to be rude, it is simply that I can't remember.

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (if i were to try to explain the "impulsiveness" it to someone that doesn't have it, its like you get these sudden inner urges to do something, and if you don't satisfy it &#40;do the thing&#41;, you get lightheaded often, aren't able to pay attention to literally anything &#40;including things you enjoy&#41;, and feel an inner anger or dissatisfaction, and cant feel in comfort with yourself or your life. and this will usually go on for months unless you do the thing, now you can probably understand that this is a huge problem, especially if "the thing" involves large financial resources. its also very normal to have "urge relapses", which is not pleasant at all.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (on the other hand however, we also have executive dysfunction, which is a really weird combination &#40;i assume you're known to this, so i wont elaborate that deeply&#41;, but its the feeling that you are just unable to do an action, usually this is something that has to be done to achieve better finances or happiness, but you just can't do it, even if you need to and you even really want to, you just, can't. it's really weird and unexplainable really if you haven't experienced it yourself.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (although, i should mention, executive dysfunction is not exclusive to adhd, its also one of the most common consequences of moderate/severe depression, and also not rare to occationally encounter)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (i would say my biggest fear is to not be able to control, or at the very least moderate or even influence my own actions or thoughts, but thats kind of already the case)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (i dont think i have autism, because im generally not terrible at social interactions n shit, but sometimes it makes me wonder how and why i can relate so well to people with autism and multiple of the symptoms it has)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (one of the things i hate with myself is that i cant figure out if something is a joke or if it's serious, even irl - and it kinda comes with this embarrasement which i dont like, because people dont understand that i quite literally dont get jokes, even if i try to explain it to them)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (if the person talking is someone i know, i may sometimes be able to get some jokes or irony based on how they usually talk and their personality, if i set off a lot of time, but i'd never have a chance at recognising irony in someone i dont know)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Was waiting for you to finish :&#41; Yea, some people might not have "read the room" the same as you, or not read the entire context. So I can totally see either side happening. Though I do see myself struggling to know that that was a joke if you didn't tell me that outright)

[//]: # (Tone is very hard to express in a way everyone understands the same)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (and another thing that i struggle with a lot and that really impacts me: not being able to understand context or base principles without them being specifically told to me, because then i remain with less knowledge than others in a given situation, and more often than its not appropriate to ask for information, as that usually just makes people label me as "puttng my nose in others business" or something similar, and me being percieved in a bad way when all i wanted was context)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (and its not just me missing out on a lot of context, its me not getting context clues that should be really obvious from the get go, that "everyone else" understands)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Like, I missed the context clue here that Krzy was going to continue with something. I mean, I could have asked "are you done?" but that could be seen as rude. And is definitely not "natural" in a conversation)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Other fun things include being asked "why did you do that?" and my answer is genuinely "I don't know" because my brain &#40;who I perceive as separate from me&#41; just told me to do it. It really makes me feel like a kid though :&#40;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (why first response would be "what is that?" or "what do you mean")

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (what i would get back is usually along the lines of "you know what i mean" or "are you dumb")
