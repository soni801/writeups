### I am weird. This write-up aims to be a short introduction, and to explain some of my 'quirks'.

I may have directed you to this write-up if you're asking questions about my behaviour, or if I've acted condescending
or rude towards you. If the latter, I'm sorry. I won't justify my actions, but I'll try to explain why they happened, in
this writeup.

In this write-up, I'll roughly cover 2 main subjects:
- [ADHD](#adhd)
- [Psychopathy](#psychopathy)

But first a small introduction. I am Samuel, but go by 'Soni' online. I'm Norwegian and work within IT, as well as have
interests within IT. I do programming and general server/IT operation and I love discussions, especially technical ones.
However, I differ from the norm in that I care a lot about the quality about a conversation, even to the point of where
I made a write-up explaining [what I think defines a healthy discussion](/healthy-discussion/). Unfortunately, the fact
that I love discussions does create bad situations as I often find myself in arguments about trivial matters, something
that annoys a lot of the people around me. Let me try to explain why:

### ADHD

I have ADHD. Well, sort of. Well, I do, but not 'officially'. Explaining this might be difficult, but I'll try to give
you the short version: The Norwegian healthcare system sucks.

### Psychopathy
