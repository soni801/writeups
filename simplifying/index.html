        <h1>Companies simplifying their logos</h1>

        <p>Here's my (probably unpopular) take on simplified logos, as a graphic design student and having worked with graphic/logo design for a couple years.</p>
        <p>Simplifying a logo is a good thing. If we see it at a very basic level: more simple = less vertices. The first problem with having many vertices is that it usually looks bad at a small scale. Most brands have a website with their logo in the header and/or footer, usually very downscaled. Some brands, like Discord, have an app. Maybe they have apparel or accessories where the logo is small, like a pin. If you have too many vertices in a space this small, it will be too much detail in a little space. Which, depending on your resolution, can look very bad and have weird artefact looking lines. In addition, focusing on small details in a small logo can be very eye straining. Many brands also want a 'flat' look to their branding, which is more easily obtained by removing vertices - making their logo simpler. In addition (this is probably the most stupid reason), many graphic designers enjoy changing things and seeing if they can make it better than what it already is.</p>
        <p>Simplifying a brand name can also be a good thing, but in most cases shouldn't be done. With names, it's more important to think about what you, and it is easier to make a mistake. The first thing someone thinks of when they think of a brand, is the brand name. The brand name is everywhere. This makes the brand name very important to get right. I think that in most cases, a name change is unnecessary, especially after you have established yourself as a brand. The only reason I think is valid for changing a brand name, is if there is a severe issue with the current name, e.g. the name not representing the company in a good way, the name having outdated information, etc. The most important thing to consider when updating a brand name, is the attachment people have to the brand. As mentioned earlier, the first thing someone thinks about when thinking about a brand, is the brand name. When this is changed, you harm the attachment people have to your brand, and people will have to adjust to the name change, which can take a lot of time.</p>
        <p>so afterall, what is my opinion on simplifying a brand look? i think it's good, as long as the brand has gone through a long thought process and really landed on 'this is what we want to do', after discussing pros and cons and how it will affect the people attached to the brand. i think the most important thing when discussing logo changes, is finding the line between 'simplifying' and 'oversimplifying'.</p>
        <p>take discord as an example. they didn't oversimplify. they simplified. the difference is that oversimplifying is simplifying to a point where it's not recognisable, while simplifying is just making it simpler, less vertices. discord simplified their logo. it is still very recognisable, everyone that knows of discord and looks at their new logo, will easily recognise that that is discord. and i think discord's reasoning is very good. i don't think flaming discord for this relatively small change is fair. discord had good reasons to change their logo, and i have yet to hear someone have a good reason that discord shouldn't change their logo, apart from 'the new logo is emotionless', or 'they took away my emotional attachment to the brand'. the first reason is just wrong. they stated in the blog post that they actually went out of their way to make the new logo in a way so that it can express emotions. the second reason is something i can understand. yes, when a brand changes their look, it can take away from the emotional attachment you have to them. and i understand that, especially because discord is a platform many use a lot, and a platform that is very important to a lot of people. but i don't think it's a good idea to base your emotions on the look, rather base your emotions off of what the platform is, the things you do on the platform, and the people you know on the platform.</p>
